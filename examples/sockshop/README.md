# SockShop

This is a Blueprint re-implementation of the [SockShop application](https://github.com/ocp-power-demos/sock-shop-demo).

Version used:
https://github.com/ocp-power-demos/sock-shop-demo/tree/807a7ba

## Getting started

Prerequisites for this tutorial:
* [thrift compiler](https://thrift.apache.org/download) is installed
* docker is installed

## Running tests

```zsh
cd tests
go test
```

## Compiling the application

To compile the application, we execute `wiring/main.go` and specify which wiring spec to compile. To view options and list wiring specs, run:

```zsh
go run wiring/main.go -h
```

If you encounter errors because of missing modules that are supposed to be replaced by local ones, do:

```zsh
cd wiring
go clean -cache -modcache
export GOFLAGS=-mod=mod
export GOWORK=off
go mod tidy
cd ..
```

The following will compile the `docker` wiring spec to the directory `build`. This will fail if the pre-requisite thrift compiler is not installed.

```zsh
rm -rf build
go run wiring/main.go -w docker -o build
```

## Running the application

To run the application, navigate to `build/docker` and run `docker compose up`. Use flag `--build` to build images if code is changed.

```zsh
docker-compose --env-file build/.env -f build/docker/docker-compose.yml up --build
```
